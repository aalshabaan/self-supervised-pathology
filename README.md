# self-supervised-pathology
Code for my Master's thesis on self-supervised learning for computational pathology

The current state of the project is a working mess, not looking forward to cleaning it up anytime soon.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebooks that have most of the work in a semi-presentable form, the Python code files are too messy for stranger eyes.
